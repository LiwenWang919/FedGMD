## Simulation with Client-State Machine
We construct a client-state machine to simulate arbitrary system heterogeneiry. In 
this state machine, a client's state will change as time goes by or some particular 
actions were taken. For example, a client will be available with a probability at each 
moment, and clients will be in state 'working' after they were selected if not dropping out.
The transfer rules across states are described in the figure below

We provide simple APIs for users to customize the system heterogeneity for simulation. Please see 
Tutorial 5.1 for details.
