In this section, we first discuss the general paradigm of horizontal FL and the corresponding implementation. 
Then, we take several existing federated algorithms as examples to demonstrate customization processes during different stages of training.
We finally list other FL paradigm across scenes (e.g. vertical FL, decentralized FL, and hierarchical FL).
